      <i>Hotel Ritz Madrid - Madrid, Spain</i>
      <br>
      This is my favorite hotel in Madrid! The hotel restaurant is amazing -
      I would definitely recommend trying the lobster! The location is perfect
      and is near many of the main tourist sights that you should see when you
      are visiting the city! It is a little expensive, but worth it!

      <i>La Ardosa - Madrid, Spain</i>
      <br>
      This is a great bodega in a busy and popular area of the city. It gets
      pretty crowded at night so I would recommend getting there early to
      secure a good seat. I heard that they are famous for their tortillas
      and they lived up to the expectation! Very fair pricing as well.
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>Sacha - Madrid, Spain</i>
      <br>
      This is a top tier restaurant in Madrid. It is a very popular restaurant
      with the locals and there are not many tourists! They have a great wine
      list and every item on the menu has been carefully thought out. It is a
      little hard to find, but I will be back next time I am in Madrid!
